            <h3>Our cause</h3>
            <aside>
                <b>Birds are some of the most beautiful animals in the world</b> and also one of the most vulnerable. These majestic creatures are often indicator species and alert humans of the changes in the environment. Unfortunately, human activity has severely impacted the native habitat of countless <b>birds</b> around the world and many are on the brink of <i>extinction</i>. In fact, two of the <b>rare birds</b> on this list are <i>extinct</i> in the wild and only captive individuals exist.
            </aside> 
            <blockquote cite= "https://abcbirds.org/blog/four-rarest-birds-in-americas/">
                <p>Over the last 500 years, as many as 183 <b>bird</b> species have gone extinct. Given that the more famous of these — the <i>Passenger Pigeon</i> and <i>Ivory-billed Woodpecker</i> — are immortalized in grainy black-and-white photos, you might be forgiven for assuming that bird <b>extinction</b> xis a thing of the past. In truth, however, this danger is far from gone.</p>
                <p>In only the last 10 years, eight birds have likely gone <b>extinct</b>. And, unlike past extinctions, which overwhelmingly affected island birds lacking the mobility to flee threats, recent disappearances have included more land-locked birds, particularly in South America.</p>
                <p>All told, approximately one-eighth of all known <b>birds</b> — 1,469 species — are now threatened with <b>extinction</b>. Of these, 222 are declared <em>Critically Endangered</em>, in most dire need of <i>conservation</i>. In some cases, only a few dozen birds survive.<small> In the worst, one or two remain. </small>       </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Despite appearances, the situation for these birds isn't hopeless. Timely, well-planned recovery efforts can work, and ABC has successfully helped pull several of the rarest <b>bird</b> species from the brink. In total, <em>25 Critically Endangered bird species</em> have begun to bounce back over the last 18 years thanks to the support of numerous conservation organizations.</p>

                                    <p><q>Migration is critical in the life cycle of birds, and without this annual journey many birds would not be able to raise their young.</q> Birds migrate to find the richest, most abundant food sources that will provide adequate energy to nurture young birds. If no birds migrated, competition for adequate food during breeding seasons would be fierce and many birds would starve. Instead, birds have evolved different migration patterns, times, and routes to give themselves and their offspring the greatest chance of survival.</p>

                                    <p>Birds are attacked and eaten by other birds, including falcons, owls and eagles. Different kinds of serpents and other reptiles kill adult and baby birds alike. Four-legged predators such as bobcats and weasels are bird-eaters.</p>
