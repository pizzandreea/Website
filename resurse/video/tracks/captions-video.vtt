WEBVTT - Parrots

1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.860
<i>This is what a macaque monkey would sound
like if it suddenly proposed.</i>

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.840
Yeah, I hate it too. Let’s play it again:

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.560
Now of course, that’s not a real monkey, it’s
a computer simulation that was part of a study

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.860
on monkey vocal tracts.
And what it shows is that monkeys have a

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.840
strikingly similar vocal structure to humans.

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.800
But despite all these similarities, they can’t
speak

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.460
So here’s a question.
Compared to monkeys, birds are nothing like us.

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.220
Yet this bird’s talking to me right now.

9
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360
How?

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.320
Birds don’t have lips. They don’t have
teeth,

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.100
their “nose” is totally different from
ours, but they do have something we don’t.

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.660
They actually have a different
kind of voice box than we do. It's called

13
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.680
a syrinx.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.900
This is Mya Thompson – She studies birds
at Cornell University.

15
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.240
They actually have two independent voice boxes.

16
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.640
In birds, and in humans, the lower respiratory

17
00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.360
system is shaped sort of like an upside down
slingshot. The top part is the trachea, or

18
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.280
windpipe, the bottom part is the lungs, and
these two pieces move air in and out.

19
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.000
In humans, the voice box is called the larynx,
and it’s located above the trachea. It contains

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.860
vocal “folds” that vibrate when air flows
through to produce sound.

21
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.190
And humans primarily shape that sound with
their mouths.

22
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.130
But in birds, the voice box is called the
"syrinx". And it’s at the bottom of the trachea.

23
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.940
Instead of just sending air through vocal
folds like we do, birds actually control the

24
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.310
muscles on the walls of the syrinx to shape
and produce sound.

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.040
Take a look at this cardinal as it sings.

26
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.260
You can actually see that the noise comes
directly from the chest. The bird extends

27
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.340
and shortens its neck and opens or closes its
beak to refine the noise, but most of the

28
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.200
control is actually happening in the syrinx.

29
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.700
It’s a powerful sound for such a small animal,
but that’s not even the most impressive part:

30
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.780
Cardinals tend to make these "whoop"

31
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.729
notes and they go by very very quickly. They're
able to produce more pitches than a piano

32
00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.439
in less than a tenth of a second.

33
00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.510
They're actually switching from
one side of the syrinx to another seamlessly

34
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.209
to make this very very incredible span of
pitches.

35
00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.300
The syrinx also lets some birds replicate
sounds with astonishing accuracy.

36
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.660
For example, BBC Wildlife caught a lyrebird
perfectly imitating a camera in the wild

37
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.340
And of course, some of them imitate us.

38
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.260
Parrots are born communicators. From the start
their brains are wired for speech.

39
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.540
So when they're first hatched they're

40
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.080
learning right away and they're learning from
everything around them.

41
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.079
But speaking human is no easy feat.

42
00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.340
We’ve got our vowels
A - E - I - O - U.

43
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.459
Our plosives
“Pocket”.

44
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.340
And a variety of consonants – that we
even sometimes struggle to enunciate clearly

45
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.340
So to pull off such clarity in human speech, parrots
really show off their ability to manipulate

46
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.769
their vocal tract.
Plosives, for example, require using our lips.

47
00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.200
To make up for the lack of lips, parrots use

48
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.840
something called esophageal speech – it's almost
like burping that comes from within the trachea.

49
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.980
The force of air replicates the plosive.

50
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820
As for vowels, where we use our lips, tongue

51
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.389
and jaw,
researchers have found that parrots move their

52
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.930
tongues forward and backward and adjust their
beak opening to alter the sound.

53
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.989
It seems like they are the only
birds that are actually using their tongue

54
00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.840
like humans do to shape the sound that's coming
out.

55
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.320
Parrots have a natural desire to communicate.
In the wild they form strong bonds with their

56
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.220
flocks, but in captivity,

57
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.219
the parrot forms a social bond with you

58
00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.639
and they want to communicate with you and
they have the vocal anatomy to start mimicking you.

59
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.920
When parrots live with us, we’re their flock

60
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.300
and they’re determined to sing our song.

61
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.220
So in this video I showed you some of the physiology that lets birds produce sounds.

62
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.440
But I wanted a quick and easy way to show you some of the interesting background research

63
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.640
on the neurology that allows some of them to speak.

64
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.980
So I created a website with Wix, where I've compiled a bunch of extras,

65
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.900
including research and related content that gets you inside the brains of these animals.

66
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.380
It's a super easy way to make a website, so click on the link below to make your own.

67
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.040
Wix doesn't directly impact editorial, but their support

68
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.380
does make videos like this one possible, so go check them out.
